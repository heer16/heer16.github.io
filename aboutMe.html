   <h1>About Me</h1>
 
   <h2>Hi, my name is Heer Thakkar</h2>
   <p>My name is Heer and I am currently a sophomore at the Information Technology & Software Engineering High School. This summer I was a mentee for BAM Microsoft.Last summer I shaped the minds of middle school girls to think like future engineers as a Eductor with Girls who Code. I am the safety captain of the First Robotics Team 3634 in the city of Bridgeport, handled by the University of Fairfield. I am also the founder and president of the Asha for Education chapter in school. Alongside that, I am the president of the debate team and president of the student body. Plus, I was recently inducted into the National Honors Society and I am a student ambassador for the school.To give back to the community, I volunteered as a math tutor at the local Mathnasium. Outside of school, I participated in various Hackathons such as Codeday at MakerBot,  Dwight Hacks hosted by Dwight Charter School in NYC and ICIMS- held at bell works: I also place 17th out of 47 of all participants of various ages - including full time adults in the IT field. </p>
