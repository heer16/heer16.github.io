    <hl>Without Water</h1>
    
    <p>Imagine having to drive 30 miles everyday to get water in the United States,absurd right! Wrong, this is the truth for many Indigenous Americans who live on Reservations. <strong>58 out of every 1,000 Native American households lack plumbing, compared with three out of every 1,000 white people.</strong> An estimated 30 percent of people on the Navajo Nation lack access to running water and must haul water, but local officials report that the actual number may be even higher. Even though water ways like the Mississippi river run through reservations, uranium contaminates the water.</p>
    <p>To solve this terrible problem I have come up with a platform where people can alert nearby reservations that they have a clean source of water that they can use called Without Water.</p>
